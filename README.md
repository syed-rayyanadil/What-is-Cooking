# What’s Cooking? Predicting Cuisines from Recipe Ingredients 

The goal of this contest is to predict the type of a cuisine. A few of the most grounded 
geographic and social affiliations are tied to region’s nearby nourishments. Each food has 
few extraordinary ingredients which make them diverse than others, or perhaps not. I would 
just like the machine to tell which food I can make by looking at a few ingredients. The 
model can be utilized by a nourishment or eatery websites for auto-categorizing the food of 
the specific nourishment or the sort of cuisine a restaurant practices in. Moreover, it can be 
valuable for building nourishment proposal by finding the similitudes between cuisines, since 
the likenesses are primarily since of the ingredients.

Machine Learning models used to carry out the prediction on the training data set. The models that we used in our project are as follows: 
<br>
• KNN <br>
• Logistic Regression <br>
• Naïve Bayes (Multinomial) <br>
• SGD Classifier <br>
• Random Forest Classifier <br>
